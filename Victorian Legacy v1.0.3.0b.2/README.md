This is to modify Victoria Universalis to Include more flavor and features from other mods like HFM to make it into a Multiplayer Mod. 
This mod was Inspired by:
- Igor by Nurse Reno
- HFM by Sighpie
- Victoria Universalis by Vic1984 

# Mod Features and Additions in Victorian Legacy
**Smaller Decisions**
- This is just to make it so you don't have to scroll endlessly through all the Province Selector and Generic Decisions and any other nation flavor that may be there.

**Row Completion**
- Row completion is a bonus that you receive on completing each row of tech in each section as shown in the image below the only way you receive the bonus is when you complete a full row of a specific section of tech.

**Province Selector and Province Specific Buildings**
- Each Province is equiped with more buildings than vanilla victoria 2 and each provide bonuses to factory output or RGO output.

- Province Selector is very similar to Universalis however its been reduced to make the mod less overwhelming/bloated.

**Multiplayer Focused**
- The goal of this mod is to try and focus on the overall balance of the mod towards a healthy multiplayer experience though along the way my updates will seem quite unbalanced and yes indeed I will make a mistake or typo somewhere and a modifier might have a 10% Population buff.

**Host Powers**
- The Host powers are what decide the settings of the game if you want the crisis to be turned on or a crossing in Italy to be disabled it's completely up to the host to decide.

**HFM Additions and many other mod Additions**
- I do like working and adding my very own work to this mod but whenever ideas for this become very hard to come up with I tend to go and look and see what additions I could pull from other mods and obviously credit them to the creator of that addition.
