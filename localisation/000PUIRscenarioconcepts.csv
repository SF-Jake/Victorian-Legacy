EVTNAME992271;Ukrainian Breadbasket;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC992271;The Ukrainian Breadbasket begins firing in 1860. It will apply province modifers that give 0.1% pop growth permanently to all provinces in the following states: Rovne, Kiev, Cherson, Crimea, Poltava. Anyone who owns this land will recieve the Breadbasket events applying the province modifiers to the land. The Ukrainian Breadbasket is Russia's main source of pop growth when it fires and is integral to Russia's position as a late game superpower. (Losing Ukrainian land in a war will wipe the modifier, but it will reapply after some time.);;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME992273;Immigration System;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC992273;The immigration system in IGoR currently rotates each month. This means that one month North America will receive all the immigrants while South America gets none and then the next month, South America will receive all the immigrants while North America gets none. The only exception to this rule is the USA, who recieves immigration during both periods.;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME992274;Italian Formation;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC992274;Italian formation in IGoR is currently under a King of the Hill System. What this means is that to form Italy you do not require any land other than Rome. To form Italy you must: Be Sardinia or Two Sicilies, own Rome, and the date is at least 1860. Whoever forms Italy will annex all other Italian minors and change tag to Italy. This will happen regardless of whether there is a player on the rival country or not.;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME992275;Prussian Lapse;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC992275;The Prussian Lapse is an event chain that exists only for Prussia. This event chain will auto annex Prussia's North German spherelings over time. Every decade up to 1860 increases the chance of Prussian North German spherelings auto annexing to Prussia. Note: German formation via rebels has been disabled.;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME992276;Portugal-Brazil Formation;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC992276;In IGoR, Portugal may form Portugal-Brazil, a united tag that accepts Portugese, Brazilian, and Afro-Brazilian. To do so they require the states of Pernambuco, Bahia, and Rio De Janeiro. Portugal-Brazil will be counted as a South America immigrant nation and can receive immigrants as such.;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME992277;Westernization;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC992277;In IGoR, uncivilized tech reforms now grant you their corresponding tech while you are still uncivilized. Upon westernizing, you will inherit those same techs as if they were researched normally (wait for the month tick).;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME992278;Combat;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC992278;In IGoR combat has been rebalanced from Vanilla significantly. There are now 3 different unit types before 1900: Baseline Units (Hussar, Artillery, Regulars) that have balanced attack and defense stats. /// Offensive Units (Cuirassier, Offensive Artillery, Offensive Infantry) that have more attack stats than baseline units but less defensive stats. /// Defensive Units (Dragoon, Defensive Artillery, Defensive Infantry) that have more defense stats than baseline units but less attack stats.;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME992279;Supply/Reinforcement Information;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC992279;Because of the way the game's supply system works not having 100% supply is devastating to reinforcement. It is for this reason it is incredibly important to make sure you can 100% supply your army otherwise you will lack reinforcement. If you reinforce 50% you will only get 50% reinforcement for the first unit and then a diminishing 50% for each sequesential unit. The first brigade may reinforce 900 the next 450 after that 225 and so on. This is why not having 100% supply is devastating.;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME992280;World Bank;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC992280;In IGoR, there is a world bank which replaces the function of gold. This serves as the games method of pumping money into the economy. The world bank will buy the excess RGO goods the entire game.;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME992281;Naval System;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC992281;IGoR uses a no naval cap system for navy. In this version of no naval cap, you must have 85% supply in order to not attrition.;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME992282;Migration and Emigration;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC992282;Pops migrate based on a variety of factors, such as: Literacy, Goods Availability, Militancy/Consciousness, Political Reforms, etc. Scaling levels of each of these factors will result in more internal migration (Pops moving from State to State, State to Colony, and Colony to Colony but never moves from Colony to State) in addition to emigration (Leaving your country to join another).;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME992283;Immigration System;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC992283;The immigration system in IGoR currently rotates each month. This means that one month North America will receive all the immigrants while South America gets none and then the next month, South America will receive all the immigrants while North America gets none. The only exception to this rule is the USA, who recieves immigration during both periods.;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME992284;Colonization Rework;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC992284;In IGoR, colonization is enabled in two phases. Phase One unlocks with the Colonial Negotiations invention in 1875 (Found under the Breech-loaded Rifles Tech). Phase two unlocks with the Indigenous Garrisoning invention in 1885 (Found under Nationalism and Imperialism Tech). Phase 1 allows all provinces with a liferating of 20 or higher to be colonized. Phase two allows all provinces with a liferating of 10 or higher to be colonized.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME992285;Assimilation;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC992285;In IGoR, the assimilation system has been completely reworked to function universally, so long as the population you want to assimilate is in a state and not a colony. The Equality national value gives a flat 50% increase to assimilation. Pops with higher literacy, lower consciousness, and lower militancy will assimilate marginally faster.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
